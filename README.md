# Trouble Board Game

This is to replicate a version of the board game Trouble.    


## The Rules
 - Each player starts with 4 pegs in a starting well.

 - A normal 6 sided die is used to determine move count.

- Upon rolling a 6 ---
  - The player can either move a peg clockwise in the play area or 1 peg can be removed from the starting well in to the starting position in the play area.
  - Roll again.

 - The player moves in a clock wise position from their base.    
   - The player cannot occupy the same position with more than one peg; however,
   - If an opponent owns a spot then the current player can occupy that space and place the opponent back into their starting well.

 - The player wins when all pegs are in their home base.  

## The Idea
- Build out the HTML/CSS to place individual positions per the Trouble board.  
- The player will roll a dice or do some random value between 1 and 6 in the middle of the board.  
- Log who won the game

## Languages and Frameworks Planning to Use
- JS
- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
